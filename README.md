Simple Python script to estimate CO₂ emissions from charging an Electric Vehicle (EV) based on the electricity generation mix.
User inputs percentage share (%) of each energy source in the mix (e.g., coal, natural gas, renewables).
Each energy source is assigned a specific emission factor (kg CO₂/kWh).
The script calculates the weighted average emissions of the mix and outputs the total CO₂ emitted per kWh consumed by the EV.
Provides a quick, scenario-based assessment of how the grid mix impacts EV sustainability.
